Hello To start the project all you have to do is:
1) Install all the requirements from requirements.txt
2) Project is built using python version 2.7 in Linux System. Please use it.
3) Execute "gui.py" as "python gui.py"
4) File "client_secret.json" is also avaliable in the project for Google API Oauth2 Client

In case You will need authentication. Just manually copy the auth link from terminal window and 
paste in browser and allow the permissions . File "mg_db.db" is an sqlite3 database to store the
information. I have not tested it at every platform due to limited resources as but it works well 
That's all you have to do. Please let me know if you need more information. Thank You
